# MotoWeather-Maps
MotoWeather Maps is a client-side web application designed to help motorcyclists plan safer and more comfortable trips. Unlike standard weather apps that only show start and end conditions, MotoWeather samples weather data along the entire route, filters for significant changes, and uses GenAI to provide custom riding advice and gear checklists.
